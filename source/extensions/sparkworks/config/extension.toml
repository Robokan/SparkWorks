# build123d is installed at the container level (Dockerfile.dev) rather than
# via Kit's pipapi, because cadquery-ocp (the OCC bindings) has native
# dependencies that need system libraries. If running outside a container,
# install manually: /isaac-sim/python.sh -m pip install build123d numpy
#
# Uncomment the lines below to let Kit's pip manager auto-install at extension
# enable time (works if system deps like libgl1 are already present):
# [python.pipapi]
# requirements = ["build123d", "numpy"]
# use_online_index = true
